    <h2>Research</h2>
    Your content should reflect<i> factual, research-based information.</i>Companies that spread <b>false</b> or <b> misleading </b><br/>
    information are vulnerable to backlash from both <small>search engines</small> and <small>consumers.</small>
    <h2>Business Goals</h2>
    Think about the business goals you want to accomplish, and how you plan to use content to do this.<br/>
<h3><u>You should understand:</u></h3>
<ul>
    <li>What type of content format you need.</li>
    <li>What style/tone you want your piece written in.</li>
    <li>What your goals are for each piece.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Buyer Persona</h2>
    As our guide to creating a buyer persona notes, a buyer persona is an abstract depiction of your ideal customer. <br/>
    It is founded upon qualitative and quantitative data from market/competitor research and existing customer profiles
    <h2>Search Intent</h2>
    Users often have very different expectations when using search engines, and, in its guidelines, Google talks a lot<br/>
about how to understand what users are looking for when using different queries. Providing exhaustive<br/>
answers to user queries increases the chances of your content being rated as quality.<br/>
<br/>
Search intent can be broken down into four distinct types:
<ul>
    <li><b>Informational</b> –<i>the searcher is looking for specific information on a topi</i></li>
    <li><b>Navigational</b> – <i>the searcher is looking for a specific web page or site</i></li>
    <li><b>Commercial</b> –<i>the searcher is considering a purchase and wants to investigate their options.</i></li>
    <li><b>Transactional</b> –<i> the searcher wants to purchase something.</i></li>
</ul>
<h2>Keyword Research and SEO</h2>
For a business, it’s important to remember that, in today’s digital era, content writing is closely aligned<br/>
with SEO copywriting. Google and other search engines play a vital role in sending organic traffic to<br/>
websites, and they value quality content.<br/>
<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
In order to effectively engage with your audience and outperform your competition’s marketing initiatives,<br/>
it helps to construct a comprehensive content strategy plan. This plan refers to how you intend to manage<br/>
your marketing content (i.e. where and when you plan to publish). Your content strategy should include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>Your content formats<b> (i.e. social media posts, articles, etc.)</b></li>
    <li>The channels you will publish on<b> (i.e. your business website, social media networks, etc)</b>.</li>
    <li>How you will manage the content<b> (who will do the posting and manage the customer engagements)</b></li>
    <li>Content construction<b> (who will actually do the writing? If outsourcing, what firm will you use?)</b></li>
    <li>Content performance<b> (who will analyze how your content is performing and report back to you?)</b></li>
</ul>
<h2>Topic Research</h2>
Take the time to carry out thorough topic research, so that you can come up with strong, strategic ideas<br/>
for your content that will resonate with your audience and drive results.<br/>
